\# Numerical ODE Solvers in Python



This project demonstrates four numerical methods for solving first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs):



\- Euler Method

\- Midpoint Method

\- Heun's Method

\- Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)



The example equation used:

$$

\\frac{dy}{dt} = -2y, \\quad y(0) = 1

$$

with the analytical solution:

$$

y(t) = e^{-2t}

$$
